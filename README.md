## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Mahesh Rayas**, a software programmer with 17 years of software engineering experience and strong programming skills. I'm a Rust enthusiast and have contributed to numerous OSS projects. Currently, I'm employed full-time with one of the Top 4 banks in Australia. In my 9-5, I work extensively with Kubernetes, Google Cloud, and Go programming.

I possess in-depth knowledge of containerization technology and the inner workings of Kubernetes. Additionally, I have experience implementing one-click AWS Account Provisioning and Management with fully provisioned VPCs, Transit Gateways, Route53 configuration, and comprehensive security and logging setups. In my free time, I delve into eBPF and WASM, primarily using Rust.

## Current OSS Projects

- **[Kube-Guardian](https://github.com/xentra-ai/kube-guardian)**: A security tool for Kubernetes utilizing eBPF technologies.

## Rust Projects

1. **UniFFI & WASM**: Multilanguage bindings for Android, iOS, and Web technologies.
2. **Kube-Guardian**: Security advisor for Kubernetes utilizing eBPF.
3. **KubeSaver**: OSS project focused on cost optimization for Kubernetes.
4. **KubeDepre**: A CLI tool for notifying deprecated Kubernetes APIs.

## About Me

Away from keyboards, I love spending time with my two kids and my lovely wife. I'm also very passionate about fitness and a gym enthusiast.
